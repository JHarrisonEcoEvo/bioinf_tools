# Simple bioinformatic tools 
## **Under construction**
A pip installable package for routine tools. THe plan is to add custom scripts for various tasks here. This will update an old repo I had that was similar in purpose but is now deprecated.

I haven't added many tools yet and need to finish the unit testing framework.

# Installation
After cloning this repo, navigate into it and type:
```pip install ./```
